Day 1 
* Agenda for the day:
- Version control system
- Git introduction and downloading
- Terminal commands
- Basic Git configuration

Version control system : 
  - What is versions how this version make sense :
    - It includes the following things : 
      - New Features
      - Bugs Removal/ fixes
      - Upgrades
      - Security patches
      - Optimization

A version control system is a software that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
It also allows you to work together with other programmers.

- The version control system is a collection of software tools that help a team to manage changes in a source code. 
- It uses a special kind of database to keep track of every modification to the code.
- Developers can compare earlier versions of the code with an older version to fix the mistakes.

* Benefits of the Version Control System : 
- The version contorl system is very helpful and beneficial in software development.
- Developing software without using version control is unsafe.
- It provides backups for uncertainty.
- Version control systems offer a speedy interface to developers.

Branching : It is special kind of feature we can create a seperate branches so that all the team members can collaborate and work on the same file or project.

Merging : It is technique of joining all the code which is written by all the developers.

Features of version control system : 
1. Centralized : 
      With help of this feature all the team members can work independently.

2. Distributed :
       This is to distribute the work with the team member and work together.


How does Git work ?

- 1. First thing we need to create a Repository.
- 2. Clone existing Repository.

First we will create a Branching
local laptop
add 
commit
push
Merge

Staging area : It is an indexing area

Commands used in command prompt to work with Git
1. git -> To check whether the git bash or git is installed or not.
2. git --version -> to check the version of the git.
3. git config --global user.name "Name" -> To configure the git globally in the system. and giving your name.
4. git config --global user.email "name@gmail.com - > To configure globallu and setting the email.
5. git config --global user.name -> To check the user name set globally to the system
6. git config --global user.email -> To check the user email set globally to the system.
7. git status -> To check the status of the repository.
8. git init -> To initialize the branch.
9. git add . -> To add all the untracked files to the repository
10. git add .\filename -> To add the particular untracked file to the repo

After adding files then the files will be in staging area. In this stage you can check with the files whether you want file or you want to remove it.
